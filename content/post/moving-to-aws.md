I work for a company that is embracing Cloud via AWS and I wanted a place to play with those services.  I was already using Route53 for my site's DNS, and I purchased my domain through Amazon.  So it made sense to start with my own blog.  For the past several years I have been using [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/site/sites/) to host my blog.  I was never happy with the layout, but it was free and integrated into other google offerings.

Then I found this write-up on how to use more DevOps-y approach to blogging using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [travis](https://travis-ci.org/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).  I like the clean layout of the Casper theme created by [vjeantet](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-casper).  So in a short time, I went from a clunky blog on a platform that controlled all my options, to a flexible website that I can tweak, change and re-theme quite easily.
